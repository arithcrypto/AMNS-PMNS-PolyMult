# AMNS-PMNS-PolyMult

In order to run the tests, please just type:

```
$ make all
$ ./main
```

Important : The script measure.sh has to be run before any test. It allows to count the instructions of a running program and it disables the Turbo boost feature so as to obtain stable measures.

Test platform : All the codes have been tested on a Dell Inspiron 7506 2n1, i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz, gcc 10.2.0 and gf2x v1.3 library.
